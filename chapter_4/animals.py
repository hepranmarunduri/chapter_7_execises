"""
Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. 
Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print 
out the name of each animal.
- Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as
A dog would make a great pet.
- Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in
common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would
make a great pet!
