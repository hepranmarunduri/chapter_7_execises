"""
Make a dictionary called cities. Use the names of three cities as keys in your 
dictionary. Create a dictionary of information about each city and include the 
country that the city is in, its approximate population, and one fact about 
that city. The keys for each cityâ€™s dictionary should be something like 
country, population, and fact. Print the name of each city and all of the 
information you have stored about it.
