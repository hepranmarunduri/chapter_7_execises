Hi, I am Hepran.
I am learning python language now.
I am learning python from a book.
The book is Python Crash Course 2nd edition (pcc2) by Eric Matthes.

In the book, to sharpen what people learn, Matthes provides exercises per chapter.
So do I.
I do the exercises.
Here, I save my solutions from those exercises.

-End.
